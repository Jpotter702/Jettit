RedditHarbor provides a robust backend for Reddit data collection, and wrapping it in a user-friendly interface could significantly broaden its usability, especially for non-technical users or researchers.

### Options for Building an Interface Around RedditHarbor

#### 1. **Web Application (React + Flask/FastAPI)**

* **Frontend**: React (or Next.js) for dynamic, responsive UI.
* **Backend**: Flask or FastAPI to interface with RedditHarbor's Python functionality.
* **Workflow**: The frontend sends search criteria or data collection parameters → the backend invokes RedditHarbor's logic → the results are returned and displayed on the UI.
* **Good for**: Interactive dashboards, visualizations, live data displays.

#### 2. **Streamlit or Gradio App**

* **Advantages**: Rapid prototyping with minimal code for UI.
* **Limitations**: Less flexible/customizable than a full-stack app.
* **Good for**: Research tools or internal apps with emphasis on functionality over polish.

#### 3. **Jupyter Notebook + Voila**

* Use notebooks with Voila to turn them into dashboards without showing the code.
* Good for academic/research use cases.

#### 4. **Integration into an Existing Platform**

* If you're already running a platform (e.g., for data science or social media analytics), you could incorporate RedditHarbor as a backend microservice.

### Suggested Architecture (React + FastAPI Example)

* `/frontend` – React UI: inputs for subreddit, filters, time range, etc.
* `/backend` – FastAPI that:

  * Accepts API calls from frontend
  * Wraps RedditHarbor collection functions
  * Stores and serves data from a database (e.g., Supabase, PostgreSQL)
* `/scripts` – RedditHarbor as a module or service called by the backend

Would you like help scaffolding such a project (e.g., FastAPI backend with RedditHarbor integration)?
