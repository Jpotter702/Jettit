Here’s a structured **Development Plan** for building a user-friendly interface around RedditHarbor, using the suggested architecture and requirements:

---

## 🚧 **Project: RedditHarbor UI Platform**

**Goal**: Create a full-stack web application that allows users to collect, search, view, and export Reddit data via a user-friendly interface built on top of RedditHarbor.

---

## 📁 **Architecture Overview**

* **Frontend**: React (with Vite or Next.js)
* **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) wrapping RedditHarbor
* **Database**: Supabase/PostgreSQL
* **Deployment**: Docker, CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Vercel/Fly.io
* **Optional**: Celery + Redis (for job queueing)

---

## 🗓️ **Phase-by-Phase Development Plan**

### 🔹 Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Integration

**Duration**: 1 week
**Goals**:

* Set up GitHub repo
* Bootstrap frontend and backend
* Connect RedditHarbor library to FastAPI

**Tasks**:

* [ ] Scaffold FastAPI backend with route `/collect`
* [ ] Create `.env` configuration for Reddit and Supabase credentials
* [ ] Setup Supabase tables or PostgreSQL schema
* [ ] Scaffold React frontend with Vite/Next.js
* [ ] Build form to input subreddit, sort type, limit, etc.
* [ ] Set up CORS, Axios, API call from frontend to backend

---

### 🔹 Phase 2: Data Collection & Storage

**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Goals**:

* Enable end-to-end data flow: input → RedditHarbor → DB

**Tasks**:

* [ ] Backend endpoint to trigger `collect.subreddit_submission()`
* [ ] Store data in Supabase/PostgreSQL
* [ ] Create status endpoint to poll job status
* [ ] Design DB tables for users, submissions, comments

---

### 🔹 Phase 3: Display & Search Results

**Duration**: 1–2 weeks
**Goals**:

* Let users view collected Reddit data interactively

**Tasks**:

* [ ] Implement results page (table/card view)
* [ ] Add filters (keyword, upvote ratio, score)
* [ ] Pagination or infinite scroll
* [ ] Format timestamps and highlight keywords

---

### 🔹 Phase 4: Export & User Management

**Duration**: 1 week
**Goals**:

* Provide data export & user personalization

**Tasks**:

* [ ] Backend endpoints for CSV/JSON/JSONL exports
* [ ] Add export buttons in UI
* [ ] Optional: implement simple login/auth (Supabase auth or Auth0)
* [ ] Allow users to see their saved queries or history

---

### 🔹 Phase 5: Finalization & Deployment

**Duration**: 1 week
**Goals**:

* Polish app, write docs, deploy

**Tasks**:

* [ ] Mobile responsive design
* [ ] Write documentation (user guide, API guide)
* [ ] Dockerize frontend + backend
* [ ] Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Fly.io/Vercel
* [ ] Conduct final testing (unit, integration, e2e)
